                <p class="word_box_title">BARK is a crowdsourcing-based parking application aims to boost the efficiency
                  for customers in reporting parking attendant, reservation, and quick checking in/out by QR code.
                  I started this GROUP project with my classmates in Dec 2018, Dr.Wyche's prototyping class. Our main goal is to improve the parking
                  situation around our campus by improving the parking experience.During the assigned developing period, which was less than a week,
                  we only had a very rough product finished. After the DEC 2018, I decided to continue revising it until it meets my expectations. </div>

                    Tn order to gave bark better structures, I splited Bark to 4 curcial functions

                      01. Reserving spots: Giving users the ability to reserve spots ahead to painful spots finding experience at high volume time ranges.
                      <br>02. QR code parking: faster check-in & out experience
                      <br>03. User profile: Saving payment and providing wallet option to finish payment.
                      <br>04. Report parking attendant: crowdsourcing-base function help you get away from tickets

                  01. The report button is on the right side of each interface which is easier
                  for users to report parking attendents without much efforts.
                  <br>
                  02. The positioning system can automatically update
                  the current location so that the users only need to spend two seconds to complete the reporting action.

                  03. After receiving the report, this app has 3 ways to notify their user which including the timer page, the lock screen page, and the police icon on the map on the main page.
                  The lock screen page provides an express payment pathway by simply tapping the notification, giving our users more chances to pay their parking before they get tickets from parking attendants.

                    <br><br>From visual perspectives, the orange and blue color combination didn't bring harmony to my design.
                    Using #d6723c to exchange the orange will be a better choice to make for building a complementary harmony.
                    <br>
                    <br>The idea of making a stopwatch to give users a better understanding of the time they left is great.
                    However, considering the use of countdown timer could be more straightforward.
                    <br>Interactions between different screens are unclear.
                    there are components, for example, the navigation shortcut that appears in some screens not only changing positions but also redundant to some screens.

                  03. The parking timer page not only gives users the exact time they parked

                  <br>03. Visualizing the reserve parking page would remind the users more easily on finding their vehicles.

                      <br><br>In my previous design, the intention of making the parking structure visually appears in the app is to help users find their vehicles easier, however, what I imagined is the ideal situation -- all parking structures have the same layout of the parking lots which isn't true in most cases. As a UX designer, the ultimate goal of our designs aims to make them accessible to our target users as much as possible. Therefore, reconfirm our target user group first then conduct more user research will be a smart thing to do before redesigning the interface.

                <p class="word_box">
                  01. I designed the navigation bar on the side due to a more understandable layout purpose.
                  <br>02. Users can add the licensed plates for their vehicles in our app. After using QR Code parking
                   or reservation. the default car plate will automatically appear on the payment and parking timer page.
                   Also, users can change their plates after they check-in with Bark.
                  <br> 03. Users can use credit cards or balance to complete their payments. They also can add new cards by simply scan their cards.

                      <br>Repeating the use of the same icon to express buttons with different meanings.
                      <br>Secondary screens shouldn't including navigation shortcuts on the screen.
                      <br>Word choices are not ideally designed, For example, changing "home" to "Map" or "Find parking" can be more intuitive.

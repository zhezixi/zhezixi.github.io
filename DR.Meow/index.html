                        My original ideas are to have a Quick access function featuring quick entries to help cat owners learn about cats through different categories,
                         and a checker function able to check diseases by filtering body parts of cats.
                         However, during the 1ST user texting, 3/6 users expressed similar concerns as: <strong>" They are more likely to find their cats' problems through their
                           behaviors rather than through body parts' symptoms. At the same time, too many symptoms are listed results frustrations while they are going through all possibilities"</strong>.
                           Therefore, I decided to change the filtering features to a conversation bot trigger by keywords, so that the users can find the information they need easier through simple keywords input.
                            If I decided to do so, the quick access feature will overlap with the checker feature. In this case, I decided to combine them as one component to locate in the navigation bar.

                        <br>
                        <strong>Through other informal user testings, both of the users fail to understand the meaning of the "checker". My new idea is to change the word choice from "Checker" to "FAQs"</strong>

                  4 of 6 users didn't find the page that monitoring pet health which is originally placed inside the "Profile" component. Dr. Meow focusing on pet health, therefore, the cat monitoring page should be the priority for users to noticed.

                  In real-world cases, we are always short on time and great ideas as well, but remember, design inspirations come from every minute of our life.
                  Don't be overly stressful and trust yourself to attempt for more possibilities. At the same time, Discussing the project with your friends and brainstorm together or share your ideas and logics with them if the project is allowable.
                  <br><br>Using sketch to visualize ideas always able to help you capture more ideas, sometimes better ideas along the way and I didn't realize that before.
                  It's true that digital prototype able to do the job as well, however, the original thoughts were lost while people are too focusing on making the prototype prettier.
                <br><br>The most crucial element within the iteration process is not only to get feedback from your perspective,
                 but also to users. That's the only way that we able to keep design going in the right direction while iterating.
                 During iterations, I was able to convert my ideas and make adjustments to my current design base on user testings and research results.
                 At the same time, accommodate my previous work with the new knowledge I earned constantly bring new insights and support me with confidence as well.
